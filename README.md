## Bash and GPIO

### Intro to GPIO pins and Bash
Can I just say, Bash is *disgusting* after using Python so long. Like, *abhorrent*. Anyway, I suppose we'll have to use it at some point, so I learned the very basics of how it works and wired up a basic LED-on-a-breadboard. Except this time, there were *two* LEDs! Exciting stuff. They were both connected to one pin on the pi so that I could control both at once. I then created a horrible (but functional) Bash script that blinked the LEDs 10 times. The main thing I learned was Bash syntax. Going in, I had no knowledge of the syntax at all. I still don't have an extremely deep understanding of the language, but it's an improvement.

### GPIO pins, cont.
Thank God. I missed Python. For this assignment, I simply created a program that would blink the LEDs in Python rather than Bash. To do this, I needed to use the GPIO module in Python, but this didn't do much besides adding in a bit of new syntax to learn. These GPIO commands are taking me back to the old Arduino assignments...
